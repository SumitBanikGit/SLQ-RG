# SLQ-RG
We collect the one and two-loop renormalization group equations of the Standard Model extended with five scalar Leptoquarks evaluated using PyR@TE (cross-checked with RGBeta) and one-loop threshold corrections while matching Scalar Leptoquark models with the Standard Model computed using Matchete (cross-checked with matchmakereft).
