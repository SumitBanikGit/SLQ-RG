# SLQ-RG
We collect the two-loop renormalization group equations of Scalar Leptoquark models evaluated using PyR@TE (cross-checked with RGBeta) and one-loop threshold corrections while matching Scalar Leptoquark models with the Standard Model computed using Matchete (cross-checked with matchmakereft).
