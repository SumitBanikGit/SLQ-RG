# SLQ-RG
We collect the one and two-loop renormalization group equations of the Standard Model extended with five Scalar Leptoquarks (SM+5SLQ) evaluated using [PyR@TE](https://github.com/LSartore/pyrate) (cross-checked with [RGBeta](https://github.com/aethomsen/RGBeta)) and one-loop threshold corrections while matching SM+5SLQ with the Standard Model computed using [Matchete](https://gitlab.com/matchete/matchete).

The analysis of the results can be found in [arXiv:2307.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.XXXXX)
